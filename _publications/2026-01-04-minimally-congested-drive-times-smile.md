**Abstract:**  
Accurate roadway travel-time prediction is foundational to transportation systems analysis, yet reliance on data-intensive congestion models or naïve heuristics limits scalability and practical adoption. This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control and turn features within a Random Forest framework. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data, derives sparse operational features (e.g., signals, stops, crossings, yielding, roundabouts), and trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference travel times. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements over shortest-path baselines under low-traffic conditions, supporting scalable applications in transportation planning, accessibility analysis, and network performance evaluation where congestion data are sparse or unavailable.
