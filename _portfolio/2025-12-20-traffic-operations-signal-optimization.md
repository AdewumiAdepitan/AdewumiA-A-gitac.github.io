## Summary
This project analyzed traffic operations and signal performance around **The Boro** area in **Tysons Corner (Fairfax County, Virginia)**, focusing on key corridors including **Leesburg Pike (Route 7), Spring Hill Road, Greensboro Drive, and Westpark Drive**.

## Objective
- Evaluate **AM/PM peak** intersection performance (delay, LOS, v/c, queues).
- Identify bottlenecks and develop **signal timing improvements** that can be implemented without roadway widening.

## Methods (Synchro / HCM 6th)
- Coded turning movement demand and existing timing/phasing.
- Tested existing conditions and compared alternative timing plans (cycle length, splits, coordination/progression, and phasing where appropriate).
