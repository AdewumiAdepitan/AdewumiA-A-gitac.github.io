Welcome! I’m a graduate research fellow, as transport engineer with training in transportation modeling, planning, and management. I’ve also built a strong track record in predictive data analytics and machine learning, and I bring complementary experience from IT-focused roles including software testing, business analysis, and Scrum/Agile delivery. I’m equally interested in the applied side of transportation through logistics and supply chain optimization and management.

What drives my work is the real-world impact of transportation: they shape daily life in ways people often don’t notice, yet they are essential to safety, access, economic activity, and overall quality of life. I enjoy connecting technical analysis to practical decisions whether that’s improving mobility, supporting policy, or building reliable, data-driven tools.

My strengths include:
- **Transportation engineering & planning** (operations, modeling, policy support)
- **Data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling**
- **Logistics & supply chain** problem-solving
- **Software testing and product/business analysis**
- **Scrum/Agile collaboration and project delivery**

I’m committed to continuous learning and effective teamwork, with a focus on adding value through curiosity, professionalism, and strong character.

## Work & interests

With close to a decade of exposure to transportation practice and research as a transport enthusiast, I’ve contributed to work that connects engineering analysis with real-world decision-making. My experience spans several areas, including:

**1) Transportation data analytics (the foundation of better decisions)**  
I use data to support planning and operations combining statistical analysis, visualization, and modeling to turn complex transportation datasets into clear, actionable insights.

**2) Safety analysis (pedestrians, cyclists, and all road users)**  
My work focuses on improving safety and mobility through evidence-based evaluation—using crash and incident patterns to identify contributing factors and support practical countermeasures.

**3) Traffic operations and control (signals and intersections)**  
I’m interested in traffic control strategies and operational performance, including signal timing, coordination, and optimization approaches that reduce delay and improve reliability while considering safety outcomes.

**4) Transportation planning and policy support**  
I engage with planning-focused work that links infrastructure, land use, and travel behavior aiming to improve access, network performance, and user experience across modes (driving, transit, walking, and biking).

**5) Logistics and supply chain**  
I bring a systems perspective to freight movement and supply chain challenges, with interest in efficiency, reliability, and the analytics needed to support operational and strategic decisions.
