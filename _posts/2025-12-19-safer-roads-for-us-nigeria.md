excerpt: "An early update on my Safer Roads for Us initiative in Nigeria—why it matters, what I’m building, and what’s next."

Roads keep country moving but they also expose people to risk every day. From high speeds and unpredictable driving behavior to unsafe intersections, limited traffic control, poor lighting, weak road markings, and mixed vehicle types competing for space, many corridors operate without the safety structure they need. Crashes often feel “normal,” yet the cost is huge: lives lost, injuries, damaged vehicles, delayed deliveries, higher transport costs, and constant stress for drivers, passengers, and everyone sharing the roadway.

This is why Adewumi A Adepitan is starting Safer Roads for Us a call-to-action movement focused on making road safety in Nigeria more visible, measurable, and harder to ignore. The initiative is being developed to combine public awareness with practical, data-informed work: highlighting recurring crash and near-miss patterns, documenting risk hotspots, and turning those observations into clear priorities that communities and decision-makers can act on. More updates are coming soon, including the project’s structure, early focus areas, and ways to support or collaborate as the movement grows.
