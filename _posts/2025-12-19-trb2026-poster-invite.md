- **Session number:** 4023  
- **Format:** Poster session  
- **Date and time: **January 14, 2026** (8:00 AM – 9:45 AM)

### What the poster is about (in one line)
The work explores how cloud-sourced safety information and natural language modeling can help identify and prioritize traffic safety risks more quickly and systematically.

If you’re attending that session, please come by my poster I'd appreciate feedback, questions, and connections with anyone working in safety analytics, AI/ML applications in transportation, or data-driven road safety.
